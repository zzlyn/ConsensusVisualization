## React apps from github

When react apps are pushed to github there is the node_modules file which is always ignored. This is because the file is huge as it contains 
all the necessary packages to run the app. (check .gitignore under consensus-vis to confirm)

Thus, to run the app once you have cloned follow these steps:

1. Open command line and cd to consensus_viz under the cloned directory

2. Make sure you have NPM installed on your computer before proceeding.

3. The following command should be run to get all those packages not pushed to github:
    npm install
This will install all the necessary packages for the app. How does it know which packages? This information is availabled in package.json file 
under dependencies section.

Updating packages (for future reference): check the latest package version number online. Updae this number in the package.json file and run 
"npm install" again. It will update to that version number.
    
4. Now do the usual:
    npm start
to run the website live on your computer. Anytime you save the files in this app, the website reflects those changes.

The rest of the steps are listed in "Creating react apps".
