## Creating react apps

1. Install NPM

2. Install create-react-app using (command line):
	npm install -g create-react-app

3. Go to the desired directory (command line), and type the following:
	create-react-app "insert-your-app-name-here"
NOTE: If you use capital letters in your app name it gives error.

4. Done. Everything is setup! Now type:
	npm start
to start a live server on your laptop for the website.

5. When you save any changes you make in the files the website automatically 
reflects the changes.

The index.js, index.css, App.js and App.css files will be available in src folder 
inside your app's directory. To understand the basic flow the programme starts running 
from the index.js file. In this file it calls the App file. The App file is where JSX 
syntax is used.

I will add this setup to our repository in some time.
